                            <p>As of May 1, 2019, we will no longer cover services when the dx code is one of the following:</p>
                            <p>Z02.1—Encounter for pre-employment examination<br />
                                Z02.3—Encounter for examination for recruitment to armed forces<br />
                                Z02.4—Encounter for examination for a driving license<br />

                        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reimbursement Policy for Treatment Rooms</h3>
                            <p>Treatment room services consist of outpatient services furnished on hospital premises that require the use of a bed and periodic monitoring for a relatively brief period of time in order to carry out certain nonsurgical procedures not performed in a specialized suite that is otherwise billable. Recovery from the effects of such a procedure is an appropriate use of the treatment room. The use of the treatment room is an expected part of a minor procedure, and it replaces the charge for an operating room and recovery room.</p>
                            <p>We reimburse treatment room services when a specific, identifiable surgical procedure has been performed or a treatment rendered that is unrelated to inpatient or outpatient services provided within the contracted global reimbursement period.</p>
                            <p>Services are subject to applicable member out-of-pocket costs, such as copayment, coinsurance or deductible to their outpatient surgery benefit.</p>

                            <p>Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. Colorectal cancer is 90 percent preventable and 90 percent treatable when detected early enough. One in three adults over the age of 50 is not up to date on colorectal cancer screening. Talk with your patients about colorectal cancer screening options.</p>
                            <p>Available colorectal cancer screenings methods include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) annually</li>
                                <li>FIT (fecal immunochemical test) annually</li>
                                <li>Cologuard every three years</li>
                                <li>Flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years</li>
                                <li>Colonoscopy every 10 years</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Whichever screening method our members choose, most of our plans cover it at 100 percent. If additional testing or related services are needed, a copay or coinsurance may apply. To check for exact coverage, members should call the Customer Service number on the back of their ID cards.</p>


                        <h2 id="codingreminders" style="text-align: center;">Coding Reminders</h2>
                            <p>Both the Medicare Advantage and commercial Marketplace condition category models are dependent on us receiving accurate diagnosis codes through claims submission. All claims submitted to us must have associated diagnosis codes. There are two areas of opportunity we need your assistance in addressing:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Code truncation, or systems limits on the number of diagnosis codes per claim submission</li>
                                <li>Claims that are not submitted at all (e.g., claims for capitated, custodial care, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These scenarios leave gaps in accurate reflections of the overall risk of the population and may inadvertently omit members from being included in care management programs directed at assisting with health outcomes for their chronic conditions. Please assess your billing practices at an organizational and provider level to ensure these situations don’t apply to you.</p>
                            <p>If you identify these issues or have concerns that the above applies to your system, contact us at <a href="mailto:CodingCounts@healthalliance.org">CodingCounts@healthalliance.org</a>, and we’ll reach out to help with a solution.</p>

                            <p>We provide coverage for CPT procedure code 92014 (ophthalmological services; comprehensive, established patient, one or more visits) once within six months.</p>
                            <p>If the patient is being seen for follow-up within six months of the comprehensive ophthalmologic service for the same condition, you should bill using CPT procedure code 92012 (ophthalmological services, medical examination and evaluation, with initiation or continuation of diagnostic and treatment program; intermediate established patient).</p>

                            <p>We provide coverage for CPT procedure code 92225 (ophthalmoscopy, extended, with retinal drawing, with interpretation and report; ophthalmoscopy initial) once per year, per eye.</p>
                            <p>Subsequent services for the same eye should be billed using CPT procedure code 92226 (ophthalmoscopy, extended, with retinal drawing, with interpretation and report; subsequent).</p>
                            

                        <h2 id="bloodpressurescreeningremindersandtips" style="text-align: center;">Blood Pressure Screening Reminders and Tips</h2>
                            <p>Hypertension is the most common reason for a person with any chronic condition to visit a clinician. It is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. Even small increases in blood pressure raise the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. The risk of death from ischemic heart disease and stroke doubles for every 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>Hypertension affects almost one-third of American adults ages18 or older (72 million people) and is uncontrolled in nearly half of those (35 million people). This population with uncontrolled hypertension represents a large pool of patients for whom clinicians could consider further clinical intervention.</p>
                            <p>Provide both initial and ongoing training to staff to ensure that blood pressure readings are taken correctly. Make sure that readings are communicated and that elevated blood pressures are reassessed.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Encourage staff to assess whether patients have used nicotine or caffeine, have exercised in the last 30 minutes or have a full bladder. Have patient sit in a chair with feet on the floor and arm supported so that the elbow is at about heart level. The inflatable part of the cuff should completely cover at least 80 percent of the upper arm. The cuff should be placed on bare skin, not over a shirt. Remove any tight-sleeved clothing.</li>
                                <li>Encourage patients to monitor their blood pressure at home. Remember to ask patients to bring their home blood pressure cuff into your office for calibration. Educate them on their blood pressure goals as well as when to report their readings.</li>
                                <li>Consider non-pharmacological treatments in addition to medications. Encourage patients to lead a healthier lifestyle including weight loss, reducing sodium intake and increasing physical activity.</li>
                                <li>Stress the importance of medication adherence to your patients. Consider prescribing a statin medication as well.</li>
                                <li>Encourage patients to participate in health coaching or care coordination. You may place an order for health coaching by using “Amb health coach.” Our members may also call 1-800-851-3379, extension 28947, weekdays 8 a.m.–5 p.m. CT to sign up for these services.</li>
                            </ul>
